choose an Epic Destiny.


============================================================================
Master of Flame
Prerequisite: Any arcane class

"The unquenchable hunger, the unrestrained passion, the merciless
destroyer. Fire serves me; be wary."

The history of pyromancy parallels the history of all magic among the
mortal races. As soon as they first dabbled in the arcane, primitive
wizards sought to apply that power to one of the most intimidating and
important natural forces of their experience: fire. They learned
rudimentary spellcraft under the difficult tutelage of flame, and
their experiments became the foundation for almost every subsequent
study.

Ironically, pyromancy’s lessened popularity indicates its
importance. It remains so fundamental that many wizards take it for
granted, relegating it to their perceived inferiors. Common
presumptions reveal the truth, however: Tales of wizardry nearly
always include at least one fireball.

As a Master of Flame, you embrace this ancient discipline without
regard for anyone’s disdain. You will show them true mastery of magic
as you devastate opponents with the force they overlook.

MASTER OF FLAME PATH FEATURES

    Combustive Action (11th level): When you spend an action point to
    take an extra action, you deal fire damage equal to your level to
    each enemy adjacent to you.

    Critical Conflagration (11th level): Whenever you score a critical
    hit with an arcane fire attack, one creature you hit with the
    attack takes ongoing fire damage equal to twice your Intelligence
    modifier (save ends).

    Swath of Destruction (16th level): When you use an arcane fire
    burst or blast attack, you can increase the size of the burst or
    blast by 1.

rolls with arcane fire attacks, and you cannot use any attack power
without the fire keyword. Additionally, whenever an enemy hits you
with a melee attack, it takes fire damage equal to 5 + your

Target: Each creature in the burst

turn. Any creature that enters the zone or starts its turn there takes
15 fire damage (a creature can take this damage only once per
turn). Make a secondary attack as an area burst 4 with the same origin
square.
  Secondary Target: Each creature in the burst
  Secondary Attack: Intelligence vs. Fortitude
  Hit: You pull the target 2 squares toward the attack’s origin
  square.
Sustain Minor: The zone persists until the end of your next turn, and
you repeat the secondary attack.

============================================================================
Elemental Anchorite
Prerequisite: Any elemental attack power

The most devoted students of the elements often withdraw from the
society of fellow mortals to contemplate the deep truths of
existence. You have chosen the lonely path of the elemental anchorite,
dedicating yourself to a life of austerity and reflection. When your
companions return to home, family, and high honors after their
adventures, you instead seek solitude in places of great elemental
power. The secrets of the universe are engraved in the stone of mighty
mountains and whispered by the winds that sigh across lonely deserts.

    Some elemental anchorites seek isolation in order to master ever
    more formidable abilities, using elemental essence to further
    whatever purposes they deem important. Others are more
    philosophical, and view themselves as servants of balance who act
    to check the excesses of forces, monsters, or villains that
    disturb the natural equilibrium of the world. The purpose to which
    you put your understanding of elemental forces is ultimately up to
    you.

ELEMENTAL ANCHORITE PATH FEATURES

    Anchorite’s Action (11th level): When you spend an action point,
    you can end all immobilizing or restraining effects on
    yourself. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to elemental attack
    rolls until the start of your next turn.

    Anchorite’s Stability (11th level): Whenever you would be knocked
    prone or subjected to forced movement, you can make a saving throw
    to remain standing or to negate the forced movement.

    Elemental Sustenance (16th level): When you use a daily elemental
    power, you can spend a healing surge.

Elemental Anchorite Attack 11: Force of Balance
You strike with perfectly measured force, using elemental power to
maximize the impact of your attack.
Encounter        Elemental
No Action      Special
Trigger: You hit an enemy with an elemental attack power.
Effect: The triggering attack deals 1[W] extra damage if it is a
weapon attack or 1d8 extra damage if it is not a weapon attack, and
the target falls prone.

Elemental Anchorite Utility 12: Shielding Element
You retain the energy of an elemental attack, shaping it into a
short-lived shield to protect yourself.
Encounter        Elemental, Varies
Minor Action      Personal
Requirement: You must have hit an enemy with an acid, cold, fire,
lightning, or thunder attack during this turn.
Effect: Until the end of your next turn, you gain resist 10 to one
damage type of the attack (one of the types noted above). In addition,
any enemy that hits you with a melee attack before the end of your
next turn takes 10 damage of that type.

Elemental Anchorite Attack 20: Elemental Transcendence
You draw upon the matter surrounding you to increase the intensity of
your elemental attacks.
Daily        Elemental, Stance
Minor Action      Personal
Effect: You assume the elemental transcendence stance. Until the
stance ends, your elemental weapon attacks deal 1[W] extra damage, and
your elemental nonweapon attacks deal 1d8 extra damage. In addition,
any enemy that ends its turn adjacent to you takes 10 damage.


============================================================================
Shadow Dancer
Prerequisite: Any teleportation at-will or encounter power, training in Stealth

You embrace the darkness as a means of perfecting the teleportation
ability that quickly becomes your trademark in combat. When you strike

appear next.

    make an attack, you can teleport up to 5 squares as a free action

    power.

As you teleport, a shadowy afterimage manifests as tendrils that reach
out to your foes.

You streak through your foes as a blur of shadow, leaving a field of
bitter darkness behind you that freezes your foes to the marrow.
Daily        Cold, Shadow, Zone
Move Action      Personal
Effect: You shift up to your speed. The squares you enter during this
movement become a zone that lasts until the end of the encounter. Any
enemy in the zone or adjacent to it when it is created takes 15 cold
damage. The zone is totally obscured to your enemies. Any enemy that
ends its turn in the zone or adjacent to it takes 10 cold damage, and
that enemy is slowed (save ends).

============================================================================
Grave Caller
Prerequisite: Bard

"Some deserve nothing but death, and those most deserving are marked
by their crimes. Like a requiem’s crescendo, I pursue the marked ever
more closely to give them their due."

Rumors of an ancient organization of assassin-bards sometimes surface
in taverns. Such tales are quickly quelled as foolish romance, of
course. If the existence of the secret group to which you belong
became common knowledge, your work would be that much harder to
accomplish.

Your shadowy organization, known as the Grave Callers, has tasked its
members to seek out and slay those who prey on the innocent. Its
leaders identify those individuals to you through clever courier drops
or magical sendings, marking them indelibly as your targets. You are
making the world a better place with each undesirable element that you
remove, and that knowledge drives you to continue your work. Through
your ancient and deadly song, you improve the chances of all other
creatures, one death at a time.

GRAVE CALLER PATH FEATURES

    Dirge of Inescapable Doom (11th level): Once per encounter as a
    minor action, you can place a deathmark on a single enemy within
    10 squares of you. The deathmark lasts until the end of the
    encounter. If you miss with an encounter attack power against a
    creature that has your deathmark, the attack still deals 1d6 +
    your Charisma modifier damage.

    Gravecall Action (11th level): When you spend an action point to
    take an extra action, you gain a +4 bonus to damage rolls until
    the end of your next turn.

    Path to the Grave (16th level): Whenever you make an attack roll
    with an encounter or a daily attack power against a creature that
    has your deathmark, roll a d20 twice and use either result.

Grave Caller Attack 11: Visions of Doom
You sing a secret note that seeks out your chosen enemy, wracking it
  with painful images of its coming demise.
Encounter        Arcane, Implement, Psychic
Standard Action      Ranged 10
Target: One creature that has your deathmark

  next turn, one ally within 10 squares of you gains a +2 power bonus to
  attack rolls against the target.

You shroud your form in dark whispers, hindering your quarry’s ability
to see you.
Encounter        Arcane, Illusion
Minor Action      Personal

creature that has your deathmark.

closer to its ordained demise.

Miss: Half damage, and ongoing 5 damage (save ends).

============================================================================
Soul Guide
Prerequisite: Cleric

"Let the light of righteousness guide you to your eternal reward."

You are a beacon in the darkness, one who reveals the way, and a
guardian of the dead. Through your holy works, you ensure that the
souls of the dead move on, free of fear and remorse, and unimpeded by
sinister entities that would use them for dark deeds. You harbor a
special hatred for undead, seeing them as perversions of the natural
order.

    Visions of past lives—leftover fragments from those you have
    saved—haunt your dreams. Although the sights are unsettling, they
    renew your commitment to guard the souls from the dangers lurking
    between this world and the next.

    When you use your soul guide powers, ephemeral bits of soul
    materialize and swirl about you.

SOUL GUIDE PATH FEATURES

    Rebuke Soul (11th level): You can invoke the power of your deity
    to use rebuke soul.

    Spiritual Guidance (11th level): Instead of spending an action
    point to take an extra action, you can spend an action point to
    regain the use of an encounter power that has the radiant keyword,
    or you can gain an extra use of your Channel Divinity class
    feature.

    Weighty Soul (16th level): When you hit an insubstantial creature
    with a power that has the radiant keyword, that creature loses
    insubstantial until the end of your next turn.

You shock your enemies to the very foundation of their being.
Encounter        Divine, Implement, Radiant
Minor Action      Close burst 5
Channel Divinity: You can use only one channel divinity power per
  encounter
Target: Each creature that has the shadow origin or the undead keyword
 in the burst

Your holy symbol erupts with divine power, tugging on the souls of all
who behold its splendor.

Standard Action      Ranged 10
Target: One creature
Attack: Wisdom vs. Will

number of squares equal to your Charisma modifier. If the target has
the shadow origin or the undead keyword, it is also dazed until the
end of your next turn.

Soul Guide Utility 12: Shadowbane Circle
You draw upon divine energy to summon a nimbus of holy light that is
anathema to your enemies.
Daily        Divine, Radiant, Zone
Standard Action      Area burst 2 within 10 squares
Effect: The burst creates a zone of bright light that lasts until the
  end of your next turn. Creatures that have the shadow origin or the
  undead keyword treat the zone as difficult terrain. While within the
  zone, those creatures gain vulnerable 10 radiant or increase their
  vulnerability to radiant damage by 10.
Sustain Minor: The zone persists.

Soul Guide Attack 20: Soul Brand
A blazing glyph appears on your enemy’s brow, emitting a holy glow
that burns its corrupted soul.
Daily        Divine, Implement, Radiant
Standard Action      Melee 1
Target: One creature
Attack: Wisdom vs. Fortitude
Hit: 3d8 + Wisdom modifier + Charisma modifier radiant damage. The
  target takes ongoing 10 radiant damage and sheds bright light on 20
  squares in all directions (save ends both). Until the target saves,
  any enemy takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls while adjacent to the
  target.
Miss: Half damage, ongoing 5 radiant damage (save ends), and no other effects.

============================================================================
Slayer of the Dead Prerequisite: Paladin

"Stay in your graves, hungry dead! Or when I am done with you there
will be nothing left to rebury."

The undead that crawl out of the earth and shamble from chill barrows
are an unnatural blight upon the land. You have taken up the charge of
destroying these horrors with the brilliant light of your faith. The
undead are no longer the people they once were, and sending them back
to their graves is the only way to respect those whose corpses walk
again in undeath.

You were appointed to your holy task after undergoing sacred rituals
and learning ancient prayers that invest you with the power to
eradicate the walking dead. This paragon path is well suited to
followers of Pelor, god of the sun and enemy of the creatures of
darkness. Paladins of Ioun too are dedicated to foiling the plans of
Vecna, who is the god of undeath as well as the keeper of foul
secrets. However, many deities encourage their followers to dispatch
the undead as violations of divine law, so slayer traditions are
strong among the devotees of many gods.

SLAYER OF THE DEAD PATH FEATURES

    Incandescent Action (11th level): When you spend an action point
to make an attack, that attack deals extra radiant damage equal to 5 +
your Wisdom modifier against the first target hit by it.

your Strength modifier. The resistance increases to 10 + your Strength
modifier at 21st level.

    Slayer's Presence (16th level): When you bloody any undead
creature or reduce it to 0 hit points, each enemy within 5 squares of
you takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls until the end of your next
turn. This is a fear effect.

Slayer of the Dead Attack 11: Light of the Living
Your strike flares with holy radiance, which sears nearby undead.
Encounter        Divine, Radiant, Weapon
Standard Action      Melee weapon
Target: One creature
Attack: Strength vs. AC
Hit: 3[W] + Strength modifier radiant damage. Each undead creature
within 5 squares of you takes radiant damage equal to your Strength
modifier and is subject to your divine sanction until the end of your
next turn.

Slayer of the Dead Utility 12: Life and Death Entwined
The undead horror strikes at you, but your divine patron foils its
loathsome touch and turns its aggression against it.
Daily        Divine, Radiant
Immediate Interrupt      Personal
Trigger: An undead enemy hits you
Target: The triggering enemy
Effect: You take no damage from the target’s attack. Your next attack

Slayer of the Dead Attack 20: Bury the Dead
The light of life gleams around you as you command the restless dead to return to their graves.
Daily        Divine, Implement, Radiant
Standard Action      Close burst 2
Target: Each creature in the burst

Miracle Worker
Prerequisite: Cleric, trained in Heal  [Foobhop counts as a cleric]

"These hands have cured the sick, healed the injured, and forestalled
death’s cruel touch."

You’ve always had a knack for the healing arts. People just seem to
recover more quickly under your care: Bones knit and cuts mend
quickly, and even sickness flees your touch. As your mastery of divine
power has strengthened, so too have your skills at tending the sick
and injured. Now life energy flows through your fingertips to anyone
you attend.

More than other clerics, you commit your life to alleviating suffering
in any form. When you are not adventuring, you might work in the
temples of any god and lend your talents to help the community,
whether supplying food to the hungry or removing sickness from the
afflicted. You bring these same sensibilities to an adventuring
group. You move across the battlefield to shore up weakness and patch
up the wounded so they can get back into the fight. You might not
directly share in the glory enjoyed by your companions, but you take
heart in knowing that they couldn’t have done it without you.

MIRACLE WORKER PATH FEATURES

    Miracle Worker Healing Action (11th level): When you spend an
    action point to use a divine healing power, each ally adjacent to
    you regains hit points equal to 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier. The

You denounce a foe, making it suffer all the pains dealt to your
friends.
Daily        Divine, Implement

"Travel swiftly as you must, but fight as fluidly as you can."

Fat Aloisus teaches any he meets who have the skill and the will to
learn. In like manner, those he teaches are instructed to pass on his
training to those whom they meet. Whether they wander for love of maps
and food, a search for truth, a lust for treasure or adventure, or a
noble quest, their wandering is aided by the lessons they learn from
other travelers.
    As a student of the Falling Needle practice and an itinerant, your
techniques aid you—typically when others decide to attack you. You

============================================================================
Paragon of Victory
Prerequisite: Cleric  [Foobhopper is a multiclass cleric, so he can do
this]

You are a chosen champion of the gods. In battle, few can stand
against you in personal combat. Even if they could match your skill,
the divine power you command inspires your allies to great deeds.
Paragons of victory stand at the center of many tales of great
victories won against overwhelming odds. When the time comes for the
gods to stand against an overwhelming foe, you can expect to fight at
the forefront of that battle, wherever that may be.

============================================================================
Master Thief
Prerequisite: Thief

To a thief in the paragon tier, mundane guardians, traps, and locks
are the stuff of mockery. In any human or dwarven city, there are few
items you could not have if you wanted them. Your attention now turns
to far greater quarry: treasures lost to time, and riches sealed away
by titans, demon lords, and worse.

backstab per encounter, but you can still use it only once per turn.

use an attack power, you can deal your Sneak Attack damage to a target
of the power regardless of whether you hit it or whether you have
dealt Sneak Attack damage to it this turn, but you must have combat

encounter, you can shift up to 3 squares as a free action.

Immediate Reaction      Personal

options other than the usual ones that come with your character]

Firstborn of Moradin
Prerequisite: Dwarf

"My strength is the eternal endurance of the mountains. I will not break."

At the dawn of creation, dwarven myths say, Moradin made the race of
dwarves. His firstborn had bones cut from bedrock, souls wrought from
iron, and hearts carved of gleaming diamonds. These firstborn were the
models after which all other dwarves were patterned.  Although the
firstborn of Moradin’s making vanished in servitude to the giants,
their fighting techniques and mystical traditions have not been
lost. A new era of dwarven heroism has arrived, and the legacy of the
firstborn continues. Those few who most skillfully follow the paths of
the ancient firstborn are slowly transformed into the image of
Moradin’s firstborn.  As one of the present-day firstborn of Moradin,
you forge a deep connection with the earth, tapping into the power
that courses through the bedrock beneath your feet. You draw on the
strength of the mountains to resist injury, expand your senses through
rock and stone, and root yourself in the bones of the earth. You are
the stuff new legends are made of.

FIRSTBORN OF MORADIN PATH FEATURES

    d20. If you roll 10 or higher, the critical hit turns into a

  gain a +2 bonus to AC, and you can ignore being pulled, pushed, slid,

============================================================================
Radiant Fist
Prerequisite: Monk, trained in Religion

"My power comes from within, and I wield it in the name of the gods."

You studied in a monastery devoted to the gods, guiding your mastery
of psionic magic with the discipline and study of your faith. You
likely worship Pelor or Bahamut, but most non-evil deities have at
least one monastery dedicated to the fighting arts.

Your monk abilities are touched by divine power, allowing you to
channel radiant energy and tap into the astral realm. Like other
monks, you move with incredible speed and hit with unmatched power. In
addition, the gods provide you with the ability to quash those who
follow the gods of evil.

Dwarf monks are frequently drawn to this paragon path, since their
piety and endurance allow them to withstand the mental and physical
demands placed on a radiant fist.

RADIANT FIST PATH FEATURES

Divinity class feature, which means you can use a single Channel
Divinity power once per encounter. You also gain a divinity feat of

Initiate of the Dragon

"The dragon holds many secrets, and with those secrets, I battle the forces of darkness."
Prerequisite: Monk

The monastery you trained at followed a rare discipline, the school of
the dragon’s wisdom. Your masters explained that in the ancient days,
the dragons taught the mightiest of mortals how to transcend their
physical forms and become as mighty as a dragon. Your monastery
teaches that with the right focus and discipline, you too can master
the secrets of the dragon.

You learn to focus your psionic power outward, unleashing the dragon’s
fiery breath and turning your skin into an armored hide of dragon
scales. You move with the dragon’s speed, dancing on the wind with
wings of psionic power. Once you master this discipline, you learn how
to transform into a dragon for a brief moment.

Half-orc monks are frequently drawn to this paragon path, since their
agility and strength serve them well on this path. By the same token,
their fiery rage matches the dragon’s anger when it is called to
battle.

INITIATE OF THE DRAGON PATH FEATURES

    Dragon's Action (11th level): When you spend an action point to
take an extra action, you can use a free action to deal fire damage to
each enemy in a close blast 3. The fire damage equals 5 + your
Strength modifier.

you already have fire resistance, it increases by 5. Whenever you take
fire damage, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls until the end of your
next turn, even if your fire resistance negates the damage.

Blows power gains a +2 bonus and ignores resistances.

============================================================================
Halfling Scoundrel
Prerequisite: Halfling

"The bigger they are, the easier they topple."

The greatest heroes of halfling legend are those who defeat giants,
dragons, or other oversized threats to their homes and communities,
using their wits, their agility, and a hefty dose of audacity. These
heroes aren’t necessarily armored warriors wielding legendary swords,
and they don’t have lands or noble titles. They are ordinary folk who
rise to the challenge of the times, proving that size and strength
aren’t needed to come out on top. You’re one of these heroes.

Like most halflings, you have found that the best way to get by in a
world full of much larger creatures is to stay out of their way. Doing
that might mean keeping out of their sight or staying on their good
side. It might also mean keeping out of their reach, or dodging their
attacks. Stealth and trickery might not be weapons and armor by
themselves, but they are a useful supplement to the finest
steel. Coupled with your natural daring and determination, these
strengths are enough to bring you victory against any foe, no matter
how large.

Compared to the legendary heroes of other races, you might come across
as a scamp or a scoundrel. But the fact that you’re crafty,
resourceful, and sometimes sneaky doesn’t make you any less of a
hero. Avandra has blessed you with courage beyond question, ingenuity
sufficient for any challenge, and the stealth you need to survive.

HALFLING SCOUNDREL PATH FEATURES

    Fearless Scoundrel (11th level): Whenever you are affected by a
    fear effect that a save can end, you can make a saving throw
    against the effect at the start of your turn. If you don’t save,
    you can make another saving throw against the effect at the end of
    your turn.

    Resourceful Action (11th level): You can spend an action point to
    gain a +5 bonus to an attack roll, a saving throw, or a skill
    check you have just rolled, instead of taking an extra action.

    Crafty Combatant (16th level): When you use your second chance
    racial power and the enemy’s attack misses after the reroll, that
    enemy grants combat advantage to you until the end of your next
    turn.

Halfling Scoundrel Attack 11: Sly Offensive
Your weapon ends up exactly where the enemy didn’t expect, leaving
that foe off balance.

Target: One creature
Attack: Dexterity or Charisma vs. Reflex
Hit: 2[W] + Dexterity or Charisma modifier damage, and the target

  modifier as an opportunity action.
Special: When you gain this power, choose Dexterity or Charisma as the
  ability you use when making attack rolls and damage rolls with this
  power. You use the same ability to determine the number of squares you
 shift.

Target: One creature
Attack: Dexterity or Charisma vs. AC
Hit: 5[W] + Dexterity or Charisma modifier damage.
Miss: Half damage.
Effect: Until the end of the encounter, if the target attacks, it must
  include you as a target if none of your allies are nearer to it than
  you are. You gain a +2 bonus to all defenses against the target’s
  attacks. If the target misses you with an attack, you can make a basic
  attack against it as an opportunity action.
Special: When you gain this power, choose Dexterity or Charisma as the
  ability you use when making attack rolls and damage rolls with this
  power.


============================================================================
Ghostwalker
Prerequisite: Monk

"I watch the souls as they depart this world for the next."

The Monastery of the Eternal Void stands at a crossroads where the
Shadowfell washes against the world’s shores. Some who study in the
monastery delve into the Shadowfell’s secrets, but most of the
disciples there contemplate the nature of life and death, the soul’s
final migration, and the fate awaiting creatures in the
afterlife. Proximity to the darkened plane informed the monastery’s
fighting techniques as they developed into their current forms.

Your training at the monastery opened your inner eye, allowing you
glimpses from this world into the realm of the dead. Those visions
left a mark on you; your flesh grew pale and dark circles ring your
eyes, as if death’s touch draws near. Despite these changes, you are
no less vital and have gained uncanny insight into the nature of souls
and their movements.

As a ghostwalker, you use psionic power to cloak yourself in shadow
and thereby avoid enemy attacks. You can also strike at a foe’s life
force, sapping its strength. Mastery of these techniques allows you to
seize your enemy’s soul and ride it to another location.

GHOSTWALKER PATH FEATURES

    Ghostwalker's Action (11th level): When you spend an action point
    to make an attack, any enemy granting combat advantage to you that

    granting combat advantage to you. In addition, when any enemy

    hit points, you can use a free action to teleport a number of
    squares equal to your Wisdom modifier. Until the end of your next
    turn, you have combat advantage against each enemy adjacent to you
    at the end of the teleportation.

============================================================================
Four Winds Master
Prerequisite: Monk

"I am as powerful as the winds and as constant as the seasons."

Devotees of the four winds strive for peace and tranquility in all
that they do. They recognize, however, that violence is sometimes
necessary to achieve greater harmony. Just as destructive winds can
carry away anything that stands against them, a monk of the four winds
is an overwhelming force.

    make an attack and the attack hits, you shift your speed after

      distance. If you don’t land at the end of this movement, you fall.

Transcendent Perfection
Prerequisite: Monk

"I am more than this flawed vessel."

The mystics of transcendent perfection believe the mortal body is a
faulty receptacle that prevents them from attaining a higher
form. They strive to overcome the body’s limitations and attain their
true potential. Just as importantly, they believe that they must
foster reason and enlightenment, and help others transcend the body to
embrace a state of harmonious existence.

    By following the transcendent path, you learn to overcome your
    physical limitations by solving the riddles of past masters. Each
    conundrum you unravel opens your mind to greater
    possibilities. You first learn to shape your words to encourage
    behavior and alter impressions, to move without interference, or
    to deny movement to those who oppose you. You learn to close
    wounds and vanquish ailments with a touch. Upon mastering the
    techniques of transcendent perfection, you can deny your enemies’
    attacks by elevating your consciousness above pain and despair.

    take an extra action, you shift your speed and are insubstantial

    Riddle of Conversation (11th level): You gain a +2 bonus to Bluff,
    Diplomacy, Insight, and Intimidate checks. You also gain training
    in one of those skills. In addition, whenever you use your Flurry
    of Blows power, one ally adjacent to you or to a target of that
    power can shift as a free action.

    Riddle of Awareness (16th level): You see invisible creatures and
    objects within 1 square of you. In addition, enemies do not gain

Radiant Fist
Prerequisite: Monk, trained in Religion

"My power comes from within, and I wield it in the name of the gods."

You studied in a monastery devoted to the gods, guiding your mastery
of psionic magic with the discipline and study of your faith. You
likely worship Pelor or Bahamut, but most non-evil deities have at
least one monastery dedicated to the fighting arts.

Your monk abilities are touched by divine power, allowing you to
channel radiant energy and tap into the astral realm. Like other
monks, you move with incredible speed and hit with unmatched power. In
addition, the gods provide you with the ability to quash those who
follow the gods of evil.

Dwarf monks are frequently drawn to this paragon path, since their
piety and endurance allow them to withstand the mental and physical
demands placed on a radiant fist.

Faithful Shield
Prerequisite: Paladin

"Behind me, friends! They shall not touch you."

You are a living bulwark, protecting the defenseless. You are the
shelter in the storm. As a faithful shield, you place your companions’
well-being above your own.

Faithful shields are supreme examples of devout warriors, found in
most of the world’s faiths. Such warriors safeguard holy sites and
divine servants. Others set out into the world to lend their talents
to those who need it most, whether the folk of a frontier town
surrounded by enemies or a band of adventurers working to thwart a
dire threat.

Rather than focusing on dealing damage, you give your companions the
time they need to win through. You might partner with another
defender, forming an impregnable wall, or work with a trusted striker,
blocking enemy attacks and creating openings for your ally. When your
group is hard pressed, you might cover the retreat, slowly giving
ground while your friends flee to safety.

"With the power of the Astral Sea flowing through me, and my faith as
powerful as a weapon, I fight as my god wills."

You become a literal weapon for your god, imbued with an extra dose of
divine power emanating from the Astral Sea. As an astral weapon, there
are no enemies you won’t oppose, no challenge you won’t take on, for
your faith is strong and your weapon sings with power from on
high. When you accept this path, the weapon you wield forevermore
glows with the silvery light of the Astral Sea.

  power again during this encounter.

"The law holds chaos at bay, and I bolster the law with my every action and deed."

You become a paragon of order, embracing this concept and fulfilling
it with every word and deed. The gods of order look favorably upon you

Vengeful Crusader
Prerequisite: Paladin, trained in Insight or Perception

"I am the righteous sword—the heaven’s blade—and there is no escaping
the painful truth of what you have done."

Hate burns hot in your heart—hate for all those who prey on the weak
and who despoil the innocent. Hate for all those who know nothing but
evil. You channel this blazing wrath into your attacks to ensure the
perpetrators pay for their crimes. Those who raise your ire can expect
no mercy from you—only death.

VENGEFUL CRUSADER PATH FEATURES

    Vengeance's Imperative (11th level): When an enemy marked by you

============================================================================
Death Dealer
Prerequisite: Rogue

"Killing’s my game."

Some people are born killers. That penchant can be channeled in as
many ways as there are reasons for slaughter. Some slay for religion
or creed, others for power or influence, and still others for money,
vengeance, glory, or just plain relief. Many who have a knack for
murder take up violent professions, from soldier or town guard to
gladiator or assassin. A few, whatever their reasons, make a career
out of slaying monsters.

    Killing is grim business, no matter who or what ends up
    dead. Nobody takes going to the grave lightly. Hands-off methods,
    such as poison, can sometimes work, as can stealthy
    techniques. Otherwise, direct and bloody conflict is the only way
    to go about butchery.

    Strangely, a lot of would-be killers think that combat has
    rules. You know differently: In battle, fair play, honor, and
    mercy are for chumps. Fighting is all about dancing with death and
    being one of those still standing when the music ends. Maybe you
    came by your “philosophy” while being schooled as an assassin or
    hired sword. Of course, an adventurer’s life has plenty of object
    lessons along the same lines: Kill or be killed.

    When you start a fight, you take a little time to size up the
    competition. After that, it’s all bloody business. If someone has
    the nerve to attack you, you make that fool pay in such a way that
    anyone watching will think twice about facing you. Nobody escapes
    you unless they have the ability to take you out of the fight, or
    you want the story of your prowess to get around.

    However you gained your skills, they are honed in accordance with
    your brutal creed. Those who go up against you risk everything. As
    proven by the boost you sometimes get from brutalizing our
    adversaries, you take at least a little pleasure in your work.

DEATH DEALER PATH FEATURES

    No Respite (11th level): Enemies adjacent to you take a -2 penalty
    to saving throws.

    Slaying Action - Death Dealer (11th level): When you spend an
    action point to take an extra action, you gain a +2 bonus to each

    Unfair Advantage (Death Dealer) (16th level): When you hit a
    bloodied foe with a melee attack, you gain temporary hit points
    equal to your Strength modifier or Charisma modifier (your

============================================================================
Rakish Swashbuckler
Prerequisite: Rogue

"With a face like that, it’s no wonder your mother loves me best!"

Life is too short to take seriously. Danger lurks in every shadow, and
an enemy waits behind every door. Those who spend every waking moment
thinking about all the bad things that could happen never leave the
house.

    Instead of wringing your hands, you throw away all your worries
    and take a devil-may-care attitude. Sure, some say you will end up
    raking the coals of the Nine Hells because of your decadent
    living. In the end, though, who’s the happier: you and your
    adventurous, libertine ways or the hidebound drudge shuddering
    under his covers?

    On one hand, you’re a charmer. Others find your infectious wit and
    bravado winsome. But you’re also irreverent, irresponsible, and
    reckless. What’s worst is that sometimes you have the hardest time
    keeping your mouth shut. Whether cracking a joke in the middle of
    a solemn funeral or shouting a barrage of insults at a demon, you
    can’t help but stir up trouble. Deep down, you know life might be
    easier if you straightened up, but where’s the fun in that?

    When you face a serious challenge, your skill with weapons comes
    to the fore. Your tongue and your body language become secondary
    instruments of derision. You seed your exploits with cutting
    insults and disdain, goading your enemies into overextending or
    making other mistakes. When an enemy gives you an opening, you
    press the advantage. In the end, you stand triumphantly over a
    fallen foe, showing once again who the greater fool is.

RAKISH SWASHBUCKLER PATH FEATURES

    Incorrigible Action (11th level): Whenever you spend an action
    point to take an extra action, enemies take a -2 penalty to attack
    rolls against you until the start of your next turn.

    take a -2 penalty to attack rolls against you (this is in addition
    to the penalty from being marked). Enemies marked by you grant
    combat advantage to your allies.

    Dastardly Opportunist (16th level): Whenever an ally scores a
    critical hit against an enemy adjacent to you, you can make a
    melee basic attack against that enemy as an immediate reaction.

      you have combat advantage against the target.
    Hit: 2[W] + Dexterity modifier damage.


============================================================================
Blade Bravo
Prerequisite: Rogue

"You think armor will protect you? Come here, and we’ll see about that."

Most knaves are little more than ruffians who have a talent for
swordplay. These individuals prowl city streets and pit their skills
against each other, trying to prove themselves. Most of these
so-called bravos have more courage than common sense. They have short
life spans and usually wind up in shallow graves. You, however, have
proved you’re different from them.

You never had formal training or studied under a master. Instead, you
developed a haphazard style born of necessity and emboldened by your
grit. You quickly learned that survival demands toughness, so you
cultivated the ability to keep scrapping even with your back pressed
to the wall.

In battle, your attacks lack the finesse and artfulness exhibited by
other rogues, yet they are equally effective. Just because you don’t
have a fancy flourish doesn’t make you any less dangerous.

BLADE BRAVO PATH FEATURES

    Cocksure Menace (11th level): Whenever you hit an enemy granting
    combat advantage to you with a melee attack, you can mark that
    enemy until the end of your next turn.

    attack, you can spend an action point to make a melee basic attack
    against that enemy. The enemy grants combat advantage to you for
    this attack, and if you hit, the attack deals 1[W] extra
    damage. If the enemy is marked by you, the attack instead deals
    2[W] extra damage.

    Back Alley Bravo (16th level): Whenever you shift, you gain a +1
    bonus to AC and Reflex until the start of your next turn.

Jack-of-All-Trades
Prerequisite: Rogue

"Yeah . . . I can do that, and that . . . and that."

You are a jack-of-all-trades; learning new skills comes naturally to
you, and you enjoy pitting your abilities against any challenge. Your
thirst for knowledge will drive you to learn new skills until the day
you die.

Since your youth, you have had an intense yearning to learn more than
what books and teachers could provide. You understood from a young age
that knowledge and skill can take you places that money and influence
can’t. You hoard knowledge the way a dragon covets its treasure,
though you are happy to share it with anyone you consider worthy, or
when doing so suits your fancy.

Folks might consider you a pack rat or a dabbler, but you know that
the items you collect and the skills you acquire will help you in the
future. And when you’re there to save the day, anyone who derided your
habits will realize the mistake and thank you.

Eladrin are a natural choice for this path because of their high
Dexterity and Intelligence, as well as the fact that they gain an
additional skill of their choice. Humans also excel as
jacks-of-all-trades because of their vast variety of experiences and
versatility of skill and knowledge.

============================================================================
Whisperknife
Prerequisite: Rogue

"Bring me vengeance, oh gods, and make my enemies pay in blood."

You have been called different names—killer, murderer, assassin—but
none fit as nicely as whisperknife does. You kill, but not for wealth
and rarely for sport; you kill for vengeance. In a perfect world,
everyone would die from old age, but this isn’t a perfect
world. Accidents happen, and wars claim soldiers and innocents
alike. Murderers snuff out lives on a whim or with cold calculation,
and the world keeps on turning. Souls wriggle free from their meat to
find whatever awaits them in the Raven Queen’s frigid embrace. And who
stands for these victims? Who protects the people whom justice
ignores? You.

You’re a vigilante, taking up the cause of those who can’t find
justice. You use your talents to hunt down anyone who perpetrates
crimes. You offer no mercy or quarter, only the whispered name of the
wronged party and the silent slash of your blade.

Your preferred weapons are daggers, whether thrown or held. You can
hide them on your person and retrieve them with ease. A dagger’s short
blade allows you to be close enough to your prey to explain why it has
to die. And when you’ve said what you need to say, you can watch as
the life goes out of your victim’s eyes.

============================================================================
Daring Acrobat
Prerequisite: Rogue, trained in Acrobatics

"Agile movement is as much offensive as it is defensive."

Acrobatics is a widespread and popular talent. All people, from nobles
to peasants, enjoy acrobatics shows, whether amid the finery of court
or the debris of the street. A few venturesome religious rites,
especially those that pay homage to Avandra or Kord, require the
skill. Mastery of the body is part of numerous education philosophies,
and acrobatics is unmatched in cultivating fitness and
balance. Thieves and burglars use the skill to ply their
trade. Training is easy to find and widely accepted. Some youngsters
attain a level of mastery well before they reach adolescence.

    Not to be underestimated is the value of such proficiency on the
    battlefield. A combatant who is adept at acrobatics can maneuver
    like no other. The adroit use of the skill opens up advantages
    that other warriors can’t attain and allows the acrobat to avoid
    being pinned down. Movement becomes quicker and smoother as the
    acrobat uses the whole body as a tool, rather than just relying on
    the feet and the legs. It’s obvious why some martial training
    includes instruction in acrobatics.

    It’s also clear that the adventurer has even more use for
    acrobatics than a warrior or a soldier does. Explorers routinely
    face perils that are best overcome with agility, poise, and a
    sense of one’s body. More than one fortune seeker owes life and
    limb to his dedicated schooling in acrobatics.

    To say that of you is a gross understatement, however. It doesn’t
    matter if you came by your skill in a formal academy, from family
    tradition, or through the school of hard knocks. You have made
    acrobatics not only an art form, but also a martial style all your
    own.

    You flabbergast friend and foe alike with your talent. Using it,
    you routinely accomplish tricks that seem beyond mortal
    capacity. With your flamboyant derring-do, you deliver terrible
    attacks and deftly capitalize on the smallest openings.

    take an extra action, you also gain an extra move action that you

  basic attack.


============================================================================
Cloaked Sniper
Prerequisite: Rogue, trained in Stealth

"You tell me—is it better to win with a shot from the dark or to lose up close?"

The advantage of getting the drop on an enemy is acknowledged far and
wide. Equally prized is the benefit of taking out important targets
with little risk. No one is better at accomplishing either task than a
trained sharpshooter, and the sharpshooter’s weapon of choice is the
crossbow.

    Nations and mercenary groups train specialized soldiers to use
    crossbows in this fashion. Underworld organizations do the
    same. Any such soldier is essentially an assassin who knows how to
    use a crossbow to slay from a distance without attracting
    notice. Dwarves in particular prize this exception to their
    normally straightforward battle tactics. That race produces fine
    snipers.

    Such shooters don’t shy away from a normal fight. They understand
    that reconnaissance and a plan, along with the ability to strike
    unseen from a great distance, are great advantages in a combat
    situation. A good ambush leaves the enemy weakened and confused,
    giving any follow-up assault a better chance of working.

    You have chosen to hone your skills along these lines. You prefer
    to strike from hiding with a wellplaced shot and to remain
    unobserved during a confrontation, aiding your allies by picking
    off foes without ever drawing notice. The hand crossbow is your
    preferred weapon.

    Sniping is the ultimate tactic for you. The sound of a bolt
    finding its target is the sweet toll of victory. A bolt you fire
    might take out a sentry in a single hit, as well as sending your
    enemies scurrying for cover. If you miss, no matter. You can slink
    back into the shadows until you have a chance to shoot again.

CLOAKED SNIPER PATH FEATURES

    Crossbow Savant (11th level): You add 5 squares to the normal
    range of any crossbow you wield and 10 squares to the long
    range. Treat a hand crossbow as an off-hand weapon, and treat any
    crossbow that has the load minor property as having the load free
    property instead.

    Sniper Action (11th level): When you spend an action point to make
    a ranged basic attack and you have combat advantage against the
    target of the attack, you can add your Sneak Attack damage even if
    you have already dealt Sneak Attack damage during this round. If
    the attack hits, you can shift 1 square.

    Versatile Combatant (16th level): When you are armed with a melee
    weapon in your main hand and a hand crossbow in your off hand, you
    do not provoke opportunity attacks when attacking with your hand
    crossbow.

============================================================================
Verdant Stalker
Prerequisite: Rogue, trained in Stealth

"My steps are as light as a leaf on the wind."

You are a creature of stealth—a warrior who treads so lightly that
even the autumn leaves remain silent beneath your step. For you,
silence is a way of life and an art.

You’re comfortable in the forest, where your abilities to move quietly
and to camouflage your movements are at their best. You prefer to wear
out your foe, dancing from shadow to shadow and from tree to tree,
peppering your enemy with ranged attacks. No enemy has yet caught you
standing still.

You might have grown up among forest-dwelling elves or fey. It’s also
possible that you were once a city dweller who has since become one
with nature. You still know of and sometimes visit urban areas, but
they have become foreign to you. The forest is your home now, and
you’re as comfortable in it as a street urchin is in the dock ward of
a city. When outsiders invade your territory, you strike back with a
furious vengeance, assaulting them with rapid volleys of missiles that
kill the intruders or drive them away.

Elves and halflings are most likely to follow this path, but any
character who favors stealth and silence, uses ranged attacks with
great skill, and is an expert forester can succeed as a verdant
stalker.

VERDANT STALKER PATH FEATURES

    take an extra action, you can make a Stealth check to become

You slide behind cover, attack your foe from a distance, and then slip
  back into the shadows again.

"Winter freezes flesh and scours the earth with icy winds that shriek
through hedgerows and mountain passes alike. I can’t think of anything
more poetic."

In the frozen wastes, and in the frost-blasted fields of winter, you
feel at home. You find the cold, harsh conditions hospitable, even
comforting. You can pull winter storms from across the world, or even
from the Elemental Chaos, and use them to ruin your enemies. When you
attack, your body is covered with ice crystals, and your skin
pales. Your spells fill the air around you with blowing snow or hail,
and powerful winds whip up.

The blizzard is your best friend and your most ferocious
servitor. With its aid, you move creatures about inside killing blasts
and knock them down with freezing vortexes of driving snow and ice.

you name friend.

Elemental Savant
Prerequisite: Sorcerer (elementalist)

You have grown confident in your ability to shape your chosen element
to your will. Winds shift and swirl at your least gesture, and flames
brighten and dance in your presence, eager to answer your call.

    Having mastered the talent of manipulating your element in the
    world around you, you now seek to understand its secret essence
    and bind it to yourself.

ELEMENTAL SAVANT PATH FEATURES

    to take an extra action, the next sorcerer attack power you use
    before the end of your next turn deals extra damage to one target

    rolls with powers granted by your Elemental Specialty class

  wind, flame, water, or loose earth and sand. This form lasts until the

  this form, you are insubstantial, you do not need to breathe, and you
  can’t take standard actions. You can squeeze through any opening at
  least 1 inch in diameter. In addition, you gain the following benefits
  based on your chosen element.

above.

    magic, secrets, and phenomena of the Elemental Chaos. Members
    report interesting discoveries to their fellows, consult with each
    other on difficult problems, and work together to collect and
    preserve unusual knowledge or resources pertaining to the Plane

    desires regarding whether to share information or respond to calls
    for assistance from their fellows. The only rule is to treat your

Dusk Oracle

    make an attack, the attack is against the lowest of each target’s
