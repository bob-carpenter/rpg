Welcome to 4th level.  You all have 4000 XPs;  see Appendix I.  The 4e
levels are kind of like half levels in the old system, except for HPs.
And the Encounters Program adventures dole them out generously for skill
challenges and quests.

* You each get to add 1 point to two abilities (Strength, Dex, etc.); this won't
  help much because the bonus formula is (Ability - 10) / 2, and the round
  down rules mean you only get a plus on even numbers.  But you do it again
  as you continue to level up, so it's not meaningless.

* You need to divvy up the magic items (plural);  see Appendix II.

* You each gain another feat; see Appendix III.

I'm wavering among a bunch of choices for next adventure;  see Appendix IV.

  4000   GRAND TOTAL


Appendix II:  MAGIC ITEMS
=========================
I forgot to mention that in the last battle in the crypt, you find:

  * suit of +2 black iron armor scale mail
        black iron: resist 5 necrotic, resist 5 fire
                    black metal color, glows red when violence flares

  * +2 Righteous Longsword (very minimal markings)
        +1d6 damage on crits vs. non-evil [vs. evil: +1d8]
        daily free action: triggered by hit, target is dazed
        until end of your next turn [vs. evil: until save ends]
        
If Ethanhawk takes Bastard Sword expertise (d10 vs. d8 damage),
I'll make it a bastard sword.

If Kretek wants to take Scale Mail Expertise (+1 AC compared to chain,
for a total of +3), I'll make the mail resizable to dwarf size.  If
Ethanhawk takes it, it's only a total of +1 more for him.  The mobility
is better than plate in that there's no minuses on athletics and endurance
for wearing it.


Appendix III:  NOTES ON FEATS
=============================

The best place I've found to look at feats is here:

   http://dnd4.wikia.com/wiki/Feat

They also have a good description of the various classes and
builds:

   http://dnd4.wikia.com/wiki/D%26D4_Wiki

It also has a good description of all the classes.  And a very
good breakdown of character creation overall:

Appendix IV:  Up Next
========================================

I'm wavering among several different next adventure possibilities,
any of which could be cajoled into being appropriate for 4th level chars:

   * an open-ended caper in an abandoned human town now taken over by
     goblins (it's a bit less monochromatic than that) to recover a lost
     but very powerful magic item (Slaying Stone)

   * a nautical pirate treasure adventure where the pirates are seafaring 
     goblins (Captain Slygo's Treasure)

   * an airship adventure with a society of adventurers (it would
     move things toward Pathfinder, conceptually, in that you'd be recruited
     by an adventuring society that cobbled the airship together) (Friendly Skies)

   * a quest to recover a Paladin that's gone missing while battling
     the Hand of Naraash, a powerful evil cult on the frontier (Heathen)

   * a quest involving a trip to the Shadowfell itself to track down a
     weapons running operation (Shadow Rift of the Umbraforge)

   * a quest to save the dwarves from an Orc invastion through old
     tunnels (mainly dungeon-based) (Bordrin's Watch)

If you really want more of Duponde and Evard, there's an adventure to his
old mansion, as well --- you've already been to Vontarin's manse.

   turn vs. the target
