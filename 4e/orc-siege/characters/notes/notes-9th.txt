Djarum
-------------------------------------------
screwed yet again --- you get another at-will!
you get a total of +8 damage if the attack is fire
you might want something like blazing starfall that does
radiant (with fire keyword, so it's best of both worlds)
or ensorcelled blade if for some reason you want a melee;
there's some others with minor control;

we could cheat here if you're feeling really cheesed and
give you a wizard attack power or another utility power (those
are the teleport, mighty spring kind of thing)
