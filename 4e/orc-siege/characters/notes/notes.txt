Wit:

I've edited down the gazillion choices to ones I think make
sense and what others have said.  I'll let you reselect your
existing powers and feats.

Thit's complicated because these all play off each other, so
you could go for a more mobile play (to get in place for sneak
attacks), more damage, or more ability to position others or
enable.



THIT
=====================================================================

8: INT
10: WIS


Level 1 At Will Power (Select 2)
-------------------------------


Sly flourish gives extra +3 damage, piercing strike goes vs.
reflex other than AC.  The deft and acrobatic options are more
move oriented.

** SLY FLOURISH (at will/standard) Dex vs. AC to hit, 1W + Dex +
Cha damage

* (NOW) PIERCING STRIKE (at will): dex vs. REFLEX (not AC), 1W + Dex
damage

* DEFT STRIKE: (at will/standard) move up to 2 squares before attack,
hit with Dex vs. AC, Damage 1W + Dex

** ACROBATIC STRIKE (pre-req acrobatics training): (at will/std) Dex
vs. AC to hit, 1W + Dex damage, shift 1 square before or after attack,
and any hit escapes a grab


Level 1 Encounter Power (Select 1)
-----------------------------------

Positioning goes vs. Will and slides 3 squares (huge!). Guarded attack
gives more damage and gives you counter-attack, whereas one-two punch
lets you hit two people with 1W damage (no mods), but sneak attack
possible on both.

* POSITIONING STRIKE (encounter/standard, light blade) Dex Vs.
Will; 1W + Dex damage;  slide target 1 square (or Cha mod = 3 squares
with artful dodger selection, which you have)

** GUARDED ATTACK: (encounter/standard - light blade) Dex vs. AC, 
2W + Dex damage;  bonus on hit: if target makes melee attack vs. you,
you get +2 defense and get a second attack of Strength vs. AC, 1W +
Strength damage

* ONE-TWO PUNCH: (encounter/standard light blade): Dex vs. AC, 1W,
attack two targets and can deal sneak attack damage to both


Level 1 Daily NOW
--------------------------------------

The blinding barrage sucks, and I'm just not seeing it from a
role-playing angle, either, so take another one, please. Duelist looks
really nice in terms fo counterattacking vs. reflex whenever someone
tries to hit you; and it's ongoing. Easy target sets up one target
with combat advantage (save ends, so it won't last long). Spinning
blad leap lets you do crazy shift before/after, so awesome for
positioning yourself to start (can combine with tumble for super
moves).

* (Power) BLINDING BARRAGE: (daily/standard with xbow or thrown
daggers): blast 3 (3 x 3 squares next to you): Dex vs. AC to hit, Dex
mod damage (5), and all targets in blast 3 blinded until end of your
next turn

* TRICK STRIKE: (daily/standard) dex vs. AC, 3W + dex damage and slide
target 1 square; plus continue to slide target 1 square with each hit
through encounter

* DUELIST PROWESS: (daily/minor) adopt duelist stance, once when an
enemy hits or misses you, you can immediate interrupt a Dex vs. Reflex
blade hit, 1W + dex damage

* EASY TARGET: (daily/standard) Dex vs. AC, 2W + dex damage, target
slowed and combat advantage and save ends (miss: half damage, target
grants combat advantage until end of your next turn)

** SPINNING BLADE LEAP: (daily/standard) Dex vs. AC, 2W + Dex damage,
shift your speed before and after attack


Level 2 Power (1)
----------------------------------------

These seem mostly geared toward movement. Tumble is huge, but
scrambling climb makes you a squirrel and more than doubles climbing
speed (usually half speed). Happy feet is nice on others turns. Hop Up
is nice if you don't want to be knocked prone and it gives you a
shift, which can take you out of the way of follow-up attacks.

* AGILE RECOVERY (at will/minor) stand up with only minor (usually
takes full move)

* GREAT LEAP: (at-will/move) athletics check to jump -- considered
running start;  otherwise jumps take standard actions

* SUDDEN LEAP:  (encounter/minor) jump 1/2 speed as minor

* SNEAK IN THE ATTACK: (encounter/minor) until start of next turn,
next ally that hits a target next to you w. combat advantage deals
your Sneak Attack damage

* HAPPY FEET: (encounter/immediate reaction to start of other's
turn) shift up to 2 squares at start of other creatures turn

* HOP UP:  (encounter/immediate reaction to knocked prone) stand up
and shift 1 square

** TUMBLE:  (encounter/move) shift up to your speed as move

* SCRAMBLING CLIMB: (encounter/move) +5 athletics check to climb your
speed + 2


Level 1 and 2 Feats (You get 2 of these, off the same list)
----------------------------------------------------------
Feats always stay on --- they're not expendable.  And they're
pretty much all awesome.  

Not sure lost in the crowd is best --- you really don't want to be
adjacent to two enemies larger than you (though humans are larger than
you, because you're small). Duelist panache gives you super-acrobatics
and a nice athletics boost to compensate your low strength.
Backstabber is an awesome plus to sneak attacks. Nimble dodge helps
with that making others re-roll. I like the flavor of two-fisted
shooter --- with crossbow offhand, you can select each round what to
use without caching/drawing and you can use two light crossbows if you
want; the followup hit on a critical will invoke an opportunity attack
for being a ranged weapon if you're in combat. 

* (NOW) LOST IN CROWD: +2 bonus to AC when adjacent to two enemies
larger than you

* DUELIST PANACHE: Charisma bonus (+3) to acrobatics and athletics

** BACKSTABBER: 2d6 to 2d8 damage from sneak attacks

** TWO-FISTED SHOOTER: treat hand crossbow as off-hand weapon; 
reload it as free action;  critical with on-hand allows ranged basic
attack with off-hand crossbow

* NIMBLE DODGE (halfling): reroll with Second Chance takes -5 penalty
and can't score a critical

* RIGGED CHANCE (halfling): if second chance doesn't work, keep it for
one more try in encounter

* OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS: whenever hit with opp attack or an enemy misses
you with opp attack, the enemy grants combat advantage until end of
next turn


ETHANHAWK
===================================================================

These really break down into things that you do that give
you power ongoing, that do a lot of damage, and that heal others
or some combo.

I'll also let you reallocate charisma to will if you want,
but I'm not sure it's good for your character other than additional
lay-on hands.  

Daily Power (1)
-----------------------------------------------------

** (NOW) RADIANT DELIRUM: (daily/std) ranged 5: Cha vs. Reflex to hit;
damage 3d8 + Cha mod (3) and target dazed until end of your next turn

turn

doesn't work): Strength vs. Fortitude to hit; 2W + Strength mod fire

those adjacent (save ends both)

storytelling side of diplomacy with non-religious healing) training in
1 skill from Bard's list; once per day use bard's majestic word (minor
action) and target gets to spend healing surge with your Charisma
bonus (+3)

** MASTER OF STORIES (Bard multiclass): skill from bard list
(PERCEPTION); get Skald's aura, which is an aura 5 that lets you twice
per encounter (bur once per turn), you or ally in aura can use minor

KRETEK
===========================================================
I figured out how to equip the large shield.

* I've replaced your standard-issue warhammer with a not-even-magic
Dwarven craghammer, which is a heavily weighted hammerhead
counterbalanced by a sharpened spke. Damage d10 and reroll 1s (it's a
"brutal" 2 weapon).  Versatile so +1 damage when used 2-handed.
Dwarves can wield with shields.

DJARUM
===================================================================

You're in good shape now with powers/feats and gear, so let's just
look at new ones.


Level 2 Elementalist Utility Power (1)
----------------------------------------

I love the all-in aspect of good timing, but it's hard to argue
against rock armor stance for your elementalist. It's what the lists
recommend to combine earth-based defenses with fire-based attacks. And
it's like iron man's armor with your Charisma. I would, of course,
send bad guys to chase you at that point. I kind of like cave sight as
done by sensitivity and control of wind currents --- let's just say
all your battles aren't going to be outdoors. Shield of Flames
certainly fits the all-fire-all-the-time option. Dragonflame Mantle is
what Paul gave my character that got killed and it sucked. Teleport's
cool, especially as we'd play it as merging into and then out of the
elements in a really creepy-fast way.  For some reason, I'm not keen
on Sorcerous Scirocco --- seems too powerful and hard to play ---
maybe if it had a +/- 1 square uncertainty on landing due to being
caught up in a windstorm I could buy it.


* ROCK ARMOR STANCE: (daily/minor - personal) Slowed (speed = 2) and
gain resistance to damage equal to Cha modifier (5); persists for
encounter or until you end on a free action

* GOOD TIMING: (daily/free action): miss a target with sorceror attack
power; reroll triggering attack. If you still miss, take psychic
damage equal to Cha mod (5) and regain use of power at start of next
turn.

* CAVE SIGHT (daily/minor): burst 20 investigation learning general
layout of terrain but doesn't go through walls;  we'd play it as an
air elemental control and sense.

* SHIELD OF FLAMES: (encounter/minor): aura 1 that lasts until end of
next turn;  partial concealment (-2 attacks);  any creature that makes
melee attack AND ends turn in aura, takes fire damage equal to your
charisma (5)

** SPATIAL TRIP: (encounter/move) teleport half your speed;  for an
elementalist, you seep into earth, water, fire, or air to move and
reassemble.  

* SORCEROUS SCIROCCO: (encounter/standard action): you and ally moves
a number of squares equal to speed + 2 --- can fly, but falls if
doesn't land during move.

* DRAGONFLAME MANTLE (encounter/interrupt): triggered by being hit,
interrupts with +1 defense and d6 fire damage versus anyone hitting
with melee until end of next turn.

Level 2 Feat (1)
----------------------------------------
If you go with Disciple of Shadow, it'll be because of the
Shadowfell on Duponde.  Ditto the shadow raven familiar, which
may not ingratiate you to the rest of the party.  

* DISCIPLE OF SHADOW:  gain darkvision with range of 2 squares

** HUMAN PERSEVERENCE: +1 saves

* ARCANE RESERVES: +2 damage on at-will arcane powers if out of
encounter arcane powers

* TOUGHNESS: +5 HPs

* IMPENDING VICTORY: +1 to attack with at-will powers against bloodied

* TENACIOUS RESOLVE: +5 feat bonus to saves against ongoing (only if
trained in endurance, which you are)

* ARCANE FAMILIAR: 
    fire lizard (not susceptible to fire) attracted to fire; 
        +2 athletics and endurance checks; resist fire increases +2
        lizard immune to fire
    least earth elemental (burrows, see through it; save vs. prone)
    least air elemental (flies/hovers; pick up objects;  
          1/2 damage falls)
    shadow raven: raven from shadowfell -- neither alive nor dead
         +2 perception, +4 bonus defnese surrpise rounds
         partial concealment from its shadows once per 
            encounter (minor)
