There's only one 3rd level storm domain "prayer" on the list for you
to choose, so here you go:

Hammering Wind:
  Encounter Standard
  Melee Weapon
  Wisdom vs. AC
  Hit: 1W + Wisdom thunder damage
       push target 1 square
       knock target prone
  Effect: allies within 3 squares slide up to 2 squares

I'd also let you take one of the lower-level powers instead, or one 
of the standard 3rd level cleric encounter prayers, but the build
guide recommends the Hammering Wind (above).

Command
  Encounter / Standard
  Range 10 (implement - holy symbol)
  Wisdom vs. Will
  Hit: target dazed until end of your next turn, and knocked prone
       OR slid 3 + Charisma mod squares

Daunting Light
  Encounter / Standard
  Ranged 10 (implement - holy symbol)
  Wisdom vs. Reflex
  Hit:  2d10 + Wisdom radiant damage
  Effect:  one ally you can see gains combat
           advantage against target until end of your
           next turn

Split the Sky
  Encounter / Standard
  Melee (weapon)
  Str vs. Fort
  Hit: 1W + Str damage, push target 2 squares and knock prone
  


Djarum
--------------------------------------------------
All you get is the ability to use elemental escalation twice 
per encounter.  Did you note the extra d10 in the fine print?
Djarum may be a one trick mage, but it's a nice trick!

I studied your sheet more closely and realized I gave you an
elemental origin "Firecaster", which yields:

   * Blazing Corona
   * 5 square dim light (25 feet) [minor to suppress/resume]
   * Primordial language skill
   * elemental "origin"

As if you needed more firepower, so to speak.
