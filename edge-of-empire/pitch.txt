(The Edge of Empire)
Early teasers going out.

* The Empire is a peaceful land spread over hundreds
  of miles of verdant farmland, rolling hills, and waterways.
  The highest status careers are farming and the priesthood.
  Strict paladins act as the imperial police.  As imperial
  doctrine dictates, "safety first."

  The empire is a small enclave now compared to the magical age,
  when humans, dwarves, and elves covered all the lands.  The
  goblin wars of the last century killed millions of folk and
  countless goblins and worse, largely through magic.  There has
  been an unspoken truce ever since.  The unfettered use of magic
  is forbidden as dangerous and subversive.   All magic use lies
  in the hands of the priesthood and their paladin enforcers.

  None dare venture beyond the edge of empire.

* I'll need you to produce two or four characters who will
  have what it takes to lead a life of adventure.   They will
  need to find their way to the Returning Adventurer's Club
  in Aldridge, the last known bastion of survivors of the former
  goblin wars.  It is in Aldridge, right at the edge of empire.
  You will meet on the club's front steps either as a group or
  coincidentally.

* The only races are human, halfling, dwarf, and half-elf.  There are
  no more pure elves and dwarves do not live longer than humans in this
  world.  Your characters are going to start young in the provinces.
  You'll need to be able to scout and soldier special forces style
  and also be leaders.  So you need stealth and people and fighting
  skills.  Don't be afraid to balance the characters and not dump
  everything into the primary stat.  Multiclass is OK with me.  If you
  are a full spellcaster other than cleric, you'll need to train in
  secret.  I think I'll make ranger a form of fighter that gets some
  wilderness skills rather than spells.
